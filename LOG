Version 0.1.2 13Jul1998 A. Fachat
Fixed a curses bug that prevented non-blocking operation.
Removed some more logs in the IEC code

Version 0.1.1 4.10.1994 A.Fachat
The directory mask stuff broke the save or write open routines...
This is fixed. I found the iec routines extremly messy (among many other...)
especially with error recovery, but nothing done on this (yet)
Fixed a bug in uncpk (brackets in the wrong place :-( ) that makes
uncpk extract only those 'compressed' bytes...

Version 0.1.0a 3.10.1994 A.Fachat
removed some annoying logouts in trap.c, making the iec routines
very slow (they are slow, after all, but now a bit less ;-)

Version 0.1.0 29.9.1994 A.Fachat
rewrote memory management - hm, actually wrote some ;-))
now all this memory management stuff (except for exrom and game)
should work now (but actually not yet tested)

25.9.1994 A.Fachat
IEC quite well, i.e. directory and file search with masks working. No
commands (rename,...) yet, but don't know if necessary at all. No real
error messages yet, only number.
Video screen address is recognized (cia2, dra and vic reg 24),
started working on color support for curses, but still problems with
curses. Added command line parsing.

12.09.1994 A.Fachat
petscii<>ascii conversion done, directory partially (no header line and
no free bytes), IEC a bit buggy, though.
Cleaned up the directories a little bit, introduced dependencies

08.09.1994 A.Fachat
IEC emulation mostly working. todo: petscii<>ascii conversion, dir,
  floppy commands

XCBM V0.0.1 6.7.1994 A.Fachat

6502 Emulator, surrounded with C64 stuff like ROMs, I/O etc. only keyboard 
and video (char mode, curses based) working.
