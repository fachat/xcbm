- separate out multiple machine types, like pet, upet/ultra-pet

- make CPU loop a big switch/case thing to improve speed

- simulating 1541:
  - simulating floppy commands       

- avoid CPU-struct, better handling of sr

- use curses for video Output
  done! but find usable keyboard sequences for special keys on C64
  - better output, for e.g. "@"
  - fix color mode
 
- Counter: have system counter to be increased, only compare
  to target values, don't have lots of counters

- Catch SIGINT and make ^C to xcbm
  how to exit xcbm? - special key-code

- get CIA Timers to work

- undocumented opcodes

- CMOS opcodes

- right timing counter values for opcodes

- real (?) mode - adjust read/write cycles to real 6502/10 behaviour
